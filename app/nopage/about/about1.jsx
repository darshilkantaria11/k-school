                <p className="xl:text-xl md:text-lg text-xs py-4 max-w-6xl text-justify">Located in the heart of Okotoks and proudly serving the surrounding Foothills area, Knottin Day Care Centre is dedicated to providing exceptional childcare. We believe that every child is a resilient, resourceful, and capable learner. Our goal is to create a vibrant, nurturing environment that fosters each child&apos;s unique identity while promoting learning through play. <br />
                    At Knottin, we support age-appropriate development through a holistic, play-based approach. Our preschool program encourages children to build independence while engaging in creative, stimulating activities that include arts, literacy, numeracy, and scienceâ€”all presented through the joy of play. <br />
                    We are committed to building strong, supportive relationships between children, parents, and educators. By working closely with families, we create a cohesive, caring community where children can thrive emotionally, socially, and academically. <br />
                    At Knottin Day Care Centre, we don&apos;t just encourage play; we facilitate growth, exploration, and lifelong learning through every interaction.</p>
