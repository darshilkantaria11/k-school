                <p className="xl:text-xl md:text-lg text-xs py-4 max-w-6xl text-justify">At Knottin School Day Care, we provide a warm, accepting, and nurturing atmosphere where each child can explore and develop their unique potential. We believe that every child is an individual with differing needs, interests, and developmental paces. Within the safety and security of our day care, children are encouraged to challenge themselves and grow through interactions with peers, caring adults, and the power of play. <br />
                    For young children, play is purposeful work and fundamental to their growth and development. Our center uses both spontaneous and teacher-directed play activities to foster social, physical, intellectual, creative, and emotional development. <br />
                    Recognizing the importance of self-esteem, our staff gently guides children toward greater self-awareness, helping them build a realistic and positive sense of their abilities while developing the social skills needed to create meaningful relationships with others.</p>
